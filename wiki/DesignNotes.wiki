== Why is there no bits twiddling functions/operators ? ==

Because the aim of th language to teach algorithm not C.
If you want to have fun with bits, use C.

== Why is there no call by reference like in C ? ==

Because you don't needed it.
There are in my opinions two use case:
 * You need call by reference in C because you allocation something
   on the stack and want to send it by its address.
   Pseudo is a managed language, the runtime provide a GC
   so this kind of problem will not arive
 * You need to write swap.
   Knowing that you will use swap in a sort algorithm, you can
   rewrite it like that
   {{{
   def swap(any[] array, int i, int j):void {
     any tmp = array[i]
     array[i] = array[j]
     array[j] = tmp
   }
   }}}
